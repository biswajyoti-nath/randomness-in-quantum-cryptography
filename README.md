# Randomness in Quantum Cryptography: A False Sense of Security?

*Author:* Biswajyoti Nath  
*Date:* July 2025

This is an independent report exploring the critical role of randomness in quantum cryptography and foundational experiments like Bell tests. It compares *Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs)* and *Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs), highlighting why *true randomness matters for cryptographic security and quantum experiments.

> âš¡ Fun Fact: I also cold-emailed several quantum researchers and pioneers for feedback on this report.
